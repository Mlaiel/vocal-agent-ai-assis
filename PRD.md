## Design Direction
The interface should feel empowering and trustworthy, with large, high-contrast elements and audio-first design that never relies solely on visual cues.

## Color Selection
High contrast complementary palette for maximum accessibility
- **Primary Color**: Deep Blue (oklch(0.3 0.15 240)) - Conveys trust and reliability
- **Secondary Colors**: Warm Gray (oklch(0.7 0.02 60)) for backgrounds, supports readability
- **Accent Color**: Bright Orange (oklch(0.7 0.15 45)) - High visibility for critical actions and alerts
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (White oklch(1 0 0)): Dark Blue text (oklch(0.2 0.1 240)) - Ratio 8.2:1 ✓
  - Primary (Deep Blue oklch(0.3 0.15 240)): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 7.5:1 ✓
  - Accent (Bright Orange oklch(0.7 0.15 45)): Dark Blue text (oklch(0.2 0.1 240)) - Ratio 4.8:1 ✓

## Font Selection
Clear, highly legible sans-serif typography optimized for low vision users with strong hierarchy for screen readers.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**: 
  - H1 (App Title): Inter Bold/32px/tight spacing for maximum clarity

  - Body (Content): Inter Regular/18px/relaxed line height (1.6)
  - Controls (Buttons): Inter Medium/16px/slightly loose tracking

## Animations
Minimal, purposeful animations that provide audio feedback rather than visual flourish, respecting reduced motion preferences and never interfering with screen readers.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Gentle pulse for recording states, smooth transitions that can be announced by screen readers
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Critical alerts get immediate attention, content loading uses audio cues

## Component Selection
- **Components**: Button, Card, Alert, Dialog for voice confirmations, Progress for audio playback, Switch for settings
- **Customizations**: Large touch targets (minimum 48px), audio feedback hooks, high contrast focus states
- **States**: All interactive elements provide audio feedback, clear focus indicators, disabled states clearly announced
